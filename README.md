Material Tunes
--
A music player inspired by [music animations - material](https://www.materialup.com/posts/music-animations-part2). Built using backbone and all music was created by [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com) for one of their assignments. Album art is mine and it is the logo I use for [camelCaseD](https://www.camelcased.com) branding.
